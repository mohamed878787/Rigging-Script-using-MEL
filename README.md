# Rigging-Script-using-MEL

This MEL script automates the process of character rigging in Autodesk Maya, streamlining the creation of complex rig setups for characters in animation and game development projects. The script offers a variety of features to expedite the rigging process while maintaining flexibility and customization options.

Features:
Auto Rigging: The script provides an automated rigging process, generating skeleton hierarchies, control rig setups, and deformers for character meshes.
Modular Components: Rigging components such as IK (Inverse Kinematics), FK (Forward Kinematics), stretchy joints, spline IK, and more are available for easy integration into the rig setup.
Control Rig Customization: Users can customize the appearance and behavior of control rigs, including shape, size, color, and naming conventions.
Skinning Tools: Tools for skinning character meshes to skeleton deformers are included, allowing for smooth deformation and realistic character motion.
Constraints and Connections: The script facilitates the setup of constraints and connections between rig components, enabling complex motion and interaction between different parts of the character rig.
UI Interface: A user-friendly interface is provided for easy parameter adjustment, visualization of rig components, and real-time feedback during the rigging process.
Usage:
Install the script:
Copy the MEL script file to Maya's script directory.
Load the script into Maya using the script editor or the "source" command.
Run the script:
Execute the script within Maya to launch the UI interface.
Follow the on-screen instructions to define rig parameters, select rig components, and generate the character rig.
Customize and refine:
Fine-tune the generated rig by adjusting control rig parameters, modifying deformers, and refining skin weights as needed.
Save and reuse:
Save the rigged character as a Maya scene file for future use and reference in animation projects.
Contribution:
Contributions to enhance the functionality, improve user experience, or fix bugs are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request for review.
